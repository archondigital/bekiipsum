# Christmas Portrait by the Carpenters

Just as I said, the spirit of [Christmas has rubbed itself on me][1] and I'm now in this "Merry Christmas" mood. It all started when took out an old album of The Christmas Portrait by the Carpenters. Year after year, it has always been like this for me, and no matter how many things I see that tell me it's Christmas season, holiday season only starts when I hear the music from this album.

We had this album on vinyl when I was a kid and I still have it even after all these years, too bad old the record player doesn't work anymore and besides I already have them on CDs and on my iTunes library.

> "Christmas for me starts when I hear music from this wonderful album, the Christmas Portrait by the Carpenters"

The music in this album greatly influenced me musically and manifested itself when I had a chance to direct and organize music for a school's Christmas Cantata eight years ago. Christmas music being produced nowadays are nothing compared to Christmas classics such as this. Nothing comes close to the warmth and that mushy feel you get when hearing this album. Take a look at [how this album came to be][2] as told by Richard Carpenter on their [website][3].

I'm sharing this Amazon mp3 player (an affiliate link, I will admit to that) so you'd get a better picture of the music I am talking about, specially to those younger folks who never really got to listen to their music.
