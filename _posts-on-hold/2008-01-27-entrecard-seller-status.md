<p>Archon has been granted Entrecard seller status last January 20 and would like to thank the people behind <a href="http://www.entrecard.com">Entrecard</a> for making it possible. On the application made a week prior to the approval, we mentioned that we&#8217;d be selling advert designs on the Entrecard shop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the day job and real life is getting in the way and we would only be able to start offering services sometime this coming February and after archon-digital.com launches version 2.0</p>
<p>In the meantime, here are some samples of Entrecard designs archondigital has done for others.<!--more--></p>
