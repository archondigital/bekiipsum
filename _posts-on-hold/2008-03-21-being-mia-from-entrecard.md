Last week, I lost my internet connection at home which resulted in me not being able to drop as frequently as before. There were even a few &#8220;zero&#8221; drop days as seen from my stats page on the Entrecard admin.

My <a href="http://www.lyricalhub.com" target="_blank">wife</a> was upset as she was just starting to like blogging and all that [slacker][1] stuff we bloggers do.

It was a <a href="http://twitter.com/archondigital/statuses/770305442" target="_blank">stupid mistake</a>, which fortunately gave me enough free time to think more about my master plan for world domination / internet entrepreneurship.

Well, all is back to normal now and I am once again back to my regular dropping routine.
