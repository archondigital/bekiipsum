I signed up for Smorty about a month ago when I read about it while on one of my friend&#8217;s blog. For a few days I kept checking back in, waiting for the tasks that were yet to come and then figured that being on the &#8220;get paid to blog&#8221; bandwagon wasn&#8217;t the thing for me as I have yet to see any opportunities.

But it turns out I was wrong and impatient.<!--more-->

After carefully <a href="http://www.archon-digital.com/2008/03/17/debt-free-how-i-wish/" target="_blank">thinking about it</a>, Blog advertising seems a perfect fit for my routine and also for this site. Smorty provides a service for advertisers to get to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smorty.com">advertise on blogs</a> and generate the needed buzz for a service or product which they offer. On the other hand, the opportunities given to the independent web publisher are numerous. Bloggers get to write their opinion about a certain service or product where advertisers would then compensate them for. This empowers bloggers by giving then another income stream for doing something that they really love doing for free in the first place.

It has been a month since I last logged in and checked for tasks and this will be my first in a series of posts as I embark on my adventures in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smorty.com">get paid to blog</a> scene.
