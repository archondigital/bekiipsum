We established <a href="http://www.yaw-yan.com" target="_blank">Yaw-Yan ArDigma</a> website to help the group generate awareness, promote the gym and eventually raise funding for its fighters training.

Entrecard came in a few months after re-launching the site which was down for a few months for some reason before I took over the admin. I saw the widget on <a href="http://www.problogger.net" target="_blank">Problogger</a>&#8216;s sidebar and wanted to sign in with this site but after having doubts I then signed up Yaw-yan first. The results were impressive as we never really<!--more--> thought that so much could come from a free service and help us achieve our objective of letting that Yaw-Yan gain some much needed international attention. Though the bounce rate was high, we never really took that bit too seriously. As I have said the site was down for a few months before I took over and seeing it getting traffic back was good news whether they stayed for less than a minute or so.

All the <a href="http://www.entrecard.com" target="_blank">Entrecard</a> activity has paid off with more magazine publishers wanting to feature Yaw-Yan on their publication plus a few more sponsorship offers.

Right now Yaw-yan is not making any drops and has dropped in its positioning on Entrecard but that will change soon. I&#8217;ve been very busy working on this site and haven&#8217;t really given Yaw-Yan that much needed attention from me lately.
