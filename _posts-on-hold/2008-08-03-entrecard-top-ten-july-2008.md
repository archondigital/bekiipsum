This month I&#8217;d figure I want to do something different. Instead of just naming each site with their descriptions ripped of their EC profile page, this month I will instead write something short about each blogger and the article I find to be of most interest to me.

So here goes my top ten droppers for the month of July 2008<!--more-->



1.  <a href="http://www.technicallyeasy.net" target="_blank">Technically Easy</a> &#8211; Paul Salmon writes about the latest tech as well as interesting articles from hardware to software and very useful web design lessons. His <a href="http://www.technicallyeasy.net/search/label/Web%20Site%20-%20Design" target="_blank">web design series of articles </a>come in very handy.
2.  <a href="http://turnipofpower.com/" target="_blank">Turnip of Power</a> &#8211; His site has been a very good source of information for me when it comes to what and how social networking ticks. The writing style is full of wit and personality and all articles are professionally well-written. Check out his &#8220;<a href="http://turnipofpower.com/2008/07/21/editing-your-wordpress-template-for-sezwho/" target="_blank">Editing Your WordPress Template For Sezwho</a>&#8221; article.
3.  <a href="http://personal-finance-management.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Personal Finance Management Guide</a> &#8211; has given me a good insight into how I&#8217;d go about with planning and growing my resources as well as that very friendly (and hilarious) reminder to <a href="http://personal-finance-management.blogspot.com/2008/07/be-sure-to-cancel-your-credit-cards.html" target="_blank">inform your credit card company about your death</a>.
4.  <a href="http://life-with-kim.com" target="_blank">Life With Kim</a> &#8211; I find it interesting to read this blog and find her art to be very elegant. Feel free to drop by her <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5548412" target="_blank">home-made jewelry online store on Etsy&#8217;s</a> and take a peek for your self.
5.  <a href="http://www.untreatableonline.com/" target="_blank">Untreatable&#8217;s Blog</a> &#8211; depression and borderline personality disorder not from some but from someone who lives with his condition and writes about it in an effort to inspire those undergoing the same medical condition as he is. His site is also home to a lot of <a href="http://www.untreatableonline.com/search/label/poetry" target="_blank">poetry</a>.
6.  <a href="http://paperkraft.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Paperkraft.net</a> &#8211; run by Ron Rementilla, this is one of the favourite sites I like coming back to. It features 3D paper models, of which my favourite is the one of <a href="http://paperkraft.blogspot.com/2008/07/wall-e-papercraft-video-game-edition.html" target="_blank">Wall-E Papercraft Video Game Edition</a>.
7.  <a href="http://marcdionisio.blogspot.com" target="_blank">My Drift</a> &#8211; a blog by Marc Dionisio which deals with electronica and r&b type of music. Check out <a href="http://marcdionisio.blogspot.com/2008/07/world-is-kind.html" target="_blank">The World is Kind</a>.
8.  <a href="http://www.joanjoyce.com/blog" target="_blank">joanjoyce</a> &#8211; Everybody loves JoanJoyce! Brace yourself for warm welcome in her community. This is where I first saw the <a title="Permanent Link to Charice Pempengco Sang A Duet With Andrea Bocelli" rel="bookmark" href="http://joanjoyce.com/blog/?p=560">Charice Pempengco &#8211; Andrea Bocelli duet</a>.
9.  <a href="http://senoload.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Sensory Over Load</a> &#8211; I have been always loved reading books and this is one of those sites where I can expect to find a lot of rare finds. See his review of the novel <span style="font-family: georgia;"><a href="http://senoload.blogspot.com/2008/06/echo-park.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;">Echo Park</span></a></span> by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Michael Connelly</span>.
10. <a href="http://www.msns-blogs.com/blog" target="_blank">Travelin&#8217; Show</a> &#8211; A photo blog pretty much describes what this is. I always look forward to seeing more photos of <a href="http://www.msns-blogs.com/blog/?cat=13" target="_blank">landscapes and nature</a>.
